<p>So I've been getting really interested in typechecking, and well, the best way
to learn is to try and explain it in words, so here we go.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of typechecking, but today I want to explain a variation
on Hindley Milner (I've also seen it called Damas Milner, please feel free to
ping with the actual truth, fact fans). This kind of type system is the kind
you'll find under OCaml, Elm, Haskell and Purescript, although each language has their own variations (and in the case of Haskell, a terrifying number of extensions to it).</p>
<h2 id="a-working-example">A working example</h2>
<p>We're going to start by typechecking the simplest stuff, and then build up
features as we go. There are three stages to our algorithm, <code>Elaboration</code>,
<code>Unification</code> and <code>Substitution</code>. We'll introduce them as we need them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>🥚 Elaboration 🥚</strong></p>
<p>Here go through the expression we'd like to typecheck, marking each
part of the AST with the thing we think it is (and if we don't know, we sort of guess). We'll also produce
a set of constraints about the types we've worked out (a constraint is
something like <strong>"I don't know <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> are but I know they're the same
thing"</strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="literals">Literals</h3>
<p>Literals are static values declared in code. Our toy language has the
<code>Boolean</code>, <code>Integer</code> and <code>String</code> types. As this means there is no ambiguity
between them, we can work out their types in the <code>Elaboration</code> stage alone.</p>
<p><img src="/images/typecheck-1-elaborate-literals.png" alt="Elaborating literal values" /></p>
<p>The values are on the left in black, the types on the right in blue. No weird surprises here, hopefully.</p>
<h3 id="let-bindings">Let bindings</h3>
<p>It is nice to be able to give things names, so we should have some let bindings
in our language. These allow us to introduce a new concept - the typechecking
environment. A let binding has two sub-expressions - the first is the one
that gets "bound" and assigned to the name, and then the body, which can refer
to the bound expression by name.</p>
<p><img src="/images/typecheck-1-elaborate-let.png" alt="elaborating let binding for let a = 1 in true" /></p>
<p>In this example, our environment (shown in green) is initially empty, but as we were able to
elaborate the type of <code>a</code> as <code>Integer</code>, the environment when typechecking the
body also includes <code>a == Integer</code>. However, this has no effect on the type of
the whole expression, as the body of the let binding is <code>True</code> which we know is of type <code>Boolean</code>.</p>
<h3 id="variable">Variable</h3>
<p>It's all well and good making variables, but it's even more useful to refer to
them later. Given a typechecking environment that already knows about <code>b</code>, we
can look it up:</p>
<p><img src="/images/typecheck-1-elaborate-var.png" alt="Elaborating variable b" /></p>
<p>If it's not there, we
throw a type error and tell the user they've made a typo or something. If it
is, then we return the type from the environment.</p>
<h3 id="if-then-else">If / Then / Else</h3>
<p>An if statement in our language is an expression, meaning it must return
something from both the <code>then</code> and the <code>else</code> branch. It contains three
sub-expressions, one for the predicate we are testing (which must be of type
<code>Boolean</code>), one for the <code>then</code> branch, and one for the <code>else</code> branch.</p>
<p><img src="/images/typecheck-1-elaborate-if.png" alt="Elaborating if True then 1 else 2" /></p>
<p>Because each of these sub-expressions are literal values, we can elaborate their
values as we did above. The return type is <code>Integer</code>, as that is the type we
have worked out for the <code>then</code> branch (it could as well be the type of the
<code>else</code> branch, they should be the same).</p>
<p>How do we ensure all our rules work out? That's the job of the constraints that
we have generated (shown in red). We have one that ensures the type of <code>True</code> matches
<code>Boolean</code>, and another that ensures the types of the <code>then</code> and <code>else</code> branches are the same.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>🥚 Unification 🥚</strong></p>
<p>Now that we have constraints, we need to check they make sense. Unification in the context of typechecking is about smashing two things
together and seeing what we learn.</p>
<p>The outcome of unification is either a type error or a set of substitutions, such as <strong>"replace all <code>c</code> values with <code>String</code>"</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the two things are the same in both cases, so everything is fine and we
learn nothing new.</p>
<p><img src="/images/typecheck-1-unify-if.png" alt="Unifying if / then / else expressions" /></p>
<h3 id="lambda">Lambda</h3>
<p>A lambda is a function abstraction. When elaborating lambdas, we don't know what the type of the argument will be. Different type systems have different approaches to this problem.
One solution is to make the programmer annotate the argument with a type (ie,
<code>\(a: String) -&gt; ...</code>). However, Hindley Milner typechecking is all about
minimising type annotations, so instead we'll guess it. We do this by creating a fresh unknown type variable called a
"unification variable". Each of these should be unique within the typechecking,
so they often use numbers with an internal counter to generate fresh ones.
We're going to use the unimaginative <code>unknown-1</code>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/typecheck-1-elaborate-lambda.png" alt="Elaborating lambda \a -&gt; a" /></p>
<p>Then, when we elaborate the body of the lambda, we add <code>a == unknown-1</code> to the
environment, which makes typechecking the variable <code>a</code> straightforward, making
the type of the whole lambda <code>unknown-1 -&gt; unknown-1</code> (the <code>-&gt;</code> meaning "a
function from a to b")</p>
<h3 id="function-application">Function application</h3>
<h4 id="elaboration">Elaboration</h4>
<p>What's the use in functions if we can't apply values to them? Given the <code>id</code> function has already been defined, let's apply a value to it.</p>
<p><img src="/images/typecheck-1-elaborate-application.png" alt="Elaborating function application for id True" /></p>
<p>Since the function type is <code>unknown-1 -&gt; unknown-1</code>, we apply <code>Boolean</code> to it,
by creating a constraint between the first <code>unknown-1</code> and <code>Boolean</code>. Then the
return type from elaboration is the second half of the function type (also
<code>unknown-1</code>).</p>
<p>Surely it should be <code>Boolean</code> though right? No, but also, yes, but also, it's
complicated...</p>
<h4 id="unifying-our-new-constraint">Unifying our new constraint</h4>
<p>Let's look at the constraint we've generated during elaboration.</p>
<p><img src="/images/typecheck-1-unify-application.png" alt="Unifying function application" /></p>
<p>As we briefly mentioned earlier, we unify values to learn things about them. Because <code>unknown-1</code> is a unification variable, it represents an unknown thing that we are trying to find out more about.
Unifying it with <code>Boolean</code> tells us <code>unknown-1</code> is actually <code>Boolean</code>, and therefore we can substitute any instance of <code>unknown-1</code> for <code>Boolean</code>.</p>
<h4 id="apply-the-substitution">Apply the substitution</h4>
<p>We apply a substitution by changing all instances of one thing in a type for another. Applying a substitution to the result of elaboration gives us our final type,
<code>Boolean</code></p>
<p><img src="/images/typecheck-1-substitute-application.png" alt="Substituting function application" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>🥚 Substitution 🥚</strong></p>
<p>Assuming we had no type errors in the previous step, then
subsitution is the process of taking all the things we have learned and
applying them to both to expression and to the other substitutions.</p>
<p>For example, if we have learned <strong>"<code>a</code> is an <code>Integer</code>"</strong> then we can change any <code>a</code>
values in our expression to <code>Integer</code>, and also change the substitution <strong>"<code>c</code>
is a pair of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>"</strong> into <strong>"<code>c</code> is a pair of <code>Integer</code> and <code>b</code>"</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="a-bigger-example">A bigger example</h3>
<p>To see Hindley Milner typechecking in action, here is a slightly bigger
example. Here we'll see how we can get full type inference without a type
annotation in sight.</p>
<p><img src="/images/typecheck-1-elaborate-lambda-2.png" alt="Elaborating \a -&gt; if a then 1 else 2" /></p>
<p>We start by elaborating the function argument, <code>a</code>. We have no idea what it is,
so we create a unification variable, <code>unknown-1</code>, and use that instead.</p>
<p>Then we move onto the body of the lambda, an if expression. The predicate
expression is <code>a</code>. Fortunately, we already have the type for <code>a</code> in the type
environment - so we can grab it. We don't know what <code>unknown-1</code> is yet, but we
have another piece of information on our side - the predicate for an <code>if</code> must
be a <code>Boolean</code>. We express this by creating a new constraint <code>unknown-1 == Boolean</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>then</code> and <code>else</code> expressions are both literals, so we can infer those
quite simply, making <code>Integer</code> the return type of the <code>if</code> expression. There is
also another constraint here, that both branches should have the same type -
<code>Integer == Integer</code>.</p>
<h4 id="unifying-our-new-constraints">Unifying our new constraints</h4>
<p>We have two contraints from elaboration.</p>
<p>First <code>Integer == Integer</code>, which teaches us nothing (but does type check).</p>
<p><img src="/images/typecheck-1-unify-lambda-2.png" alt="Unifying big lambda" /></p>
<p>Secondly <code>unknown-1 == Boolean</code> gives us a substitution.</p>
<h4 id="apply-the-substitution-1">Apply the substitution</h4>
<p><img src="/images/typecheck-1-substitute-lambda-2.png" alt="Substituting big lambda" /></p>
<p>So, therefore, the type of <code>\a -&gt; if a then 1 else 2</code> is <code>Boolean -&gt; Integer</code>.</p>
<h3 id="that-s-all-folks">That's all folks</h3>
<p>The writing that is, that is the end of the writing. There is a bunch more to
Hindley Milner typechecking, we've neatly sidestepped any complicated
polymorphism, however rest assured that it doesn't make things <em>too</em> much
complicated which is nice. I might write about that in future, so given the
glacial pace of my writing, look forward to a sequel in 2024.</p>
