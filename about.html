        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hello. My name is Daniel J Harvey. After arsing around doing various other things I have fallen into computers as a furtive source of both income and frustration. My particular interests are in typed functional programming languages because I am a big fan of getting the compiler to do the hard work for me. I intend to use this as a place to write things down in an attempt to better understand them myself. If you are also trying to understand these things I hope they help in some way.</p>
